With my bucket list app you can track your progress by adding tasks or organise goals in lists. 
They're a useful tool to get you exploring the world and making the most of every moment. 
Keep track of places around the world you've been or want to visit in the future.
You are able to add some comments or nice memories.
With this app you ae having something to look forward to can be a form of escapism. 
But better than that, instead of it just being a dream, it’s something you’re actively working towards making come true.
